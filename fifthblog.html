They focus on increasing the “number, diversity, and impact of LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs and amplify the stories to drive the economic empowerment of the community.” Additionally, they put together events all around the United States in various cities to network or demo solutions! 
        
        Trans*H4CK – This organization is solely focused on barriers faced by trans, gender non-conforming, and non-binary people, such as unemployment, financial stability, homelessness, and discrimination.
