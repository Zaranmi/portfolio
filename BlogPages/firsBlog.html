        Today’s topic is a tough one in particular for me. I’ve come to learn that it’s not an easy one to discuss, and I haven’t perfected how to say it. Because of this, I’ve found that I just blurt it out. Plus, let’s be honest, is there any eloquent way to say it? 

A few weeks ago, I had a miscarriage. 

It is still incredibly raw and painful – both physically and mentally, but after discussing it with my partner, I knew I wanted to share this with others since there’s a bigger picture to my loss. 

Here’s the thing, I’ve always had empathy for women who wanted to be mothers, who were struggling to be parents, or who opted for an abortion or adoption. BUT, experiencing it changes you, whether it’s the excruciating pain, discomfort, or experiencing grief and loss (and so much more). 

Ultimately, this experience made me see the world differently, whether it was friendships, my own relationship, society, and yes, the tech industry. I thought I would share some of these insights, as they may be valuable for those who have gone or are going through this, or for those who are learning how to support a friend and/or improve workplace culture.

Questions / Comments 

As you might imagine, I’ve gotten my fair share of questions or comments over the weeks. Some are appropriate and empathetic, and others, well inconsiderate and…cruel, to be quite honest. I know that these folx meant well, but the impact was me trying to “pretend I was OK” or running to the bathroom immediately to cry. Sad, but that’s my truth y’all! 

Below are some questions or comments I personally wouldn’t recommend. Keep in mind that everyone is different, but if you have questions, let the person miscarrying set the boundaries. 

“Were you going to keep the baby if you didn’t lose it?” I mean, I just well up in tears thinking about this question that was asked. When confiding in my pain around this, a good friend said to me, “it doesn’t  matter because you had a choice taken away from you.” Let me tell you, that was a breath of fresh air. 
General comments I’ve received also include around drinking and “going out.” I imagine this is because people believe that going out, “forgetting my problems,” or “blowing off some steam” can give me a night off or something. Maybe someone else would find that valuable (perhaps I will in the future), but while I was miscarrying, it sucked because it insinuated that this is something a night of letting loose can help recover. (Plus, let’s not forget alcohol is a depressant, so probably not the best option when you’re depressed!) I will say it’s been nice having friends understand I’d like to not be alone but don’t necessarily want to “party”. 
“Were you trying to get pregnant?” Y’all, this one gutted me as well. It’s another example of those questions that just aren’t necessary to the conversation. Why does it matter if I was trying or not? Does that somehow relieve me of some pain? Do I not get to experience the grief or the feeling of loss that occurs? 
“Let us know what you need.” I view this one as a double-edged sword depending on the person. Some individuals prefer to have the ball in their court to tell people exactly what they need from them. On the other hand, some folx just want to be taken care of during this experience. It is one of those situations where you want to tread carefully and determine the best way to be supportive. Either way, you probably want to be there for the person in some capacity even if they don’t outright say precisely what they need because that’s difficult. Anything from texting them to check-in, just chat, visiting, or sending a gift might be an option depending on the person.
